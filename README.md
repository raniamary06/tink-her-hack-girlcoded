# [Team Mosaic] 🎯


## Basic Details

### Team Name: [girlcoded]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [M R Devika] - [Government Engineering College Thrissur]
- Member 2: [Rania Mary Soby] - [Government Engineering College Thrissur]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://tink-her-hack-girlcoded-peach.vercel.app/]

### Project Description
[finding a teammate who actually pulls their weight is a gamble. teammosaic fixes that. instead of random pairings, we match you with people who match your energy, working style, and schedule. it’s about finding the "missing piece" to your puzzle so projects actually get finished. plus, with a safety-first women-only layer, you can collaborate with total peace of mind.]

### The Problem statement
[teams fail not because of lack of skills, but because of mismatched working styles and communication preferences. women often adapt silently in teams, leading to stress and burnout. Existing team formation tools focus only on skills and roles, not on how people actually work together. this creates unhealthy and inefficient team dynamics]

### The Solution
[we propose a platform that works like a “tinder for developers,” where instead of swiping based on looks or skills, users are matched based on their working style, communication preferences, stress behavior, and daily routines. developers answer a few quick questions, and the platform matches them into compatible teams that are more likely to collaborate comfortably, reduce stress, and work efficiently together.]
